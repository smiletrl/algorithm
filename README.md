# Algorithm

This holds algorithms I practiced in programming, mainly for problems at https://leetcode.com.

All problems are solved in Go, but sometimes I'm curious about other languages performance, so there might be additional Python/Rust solution as well as Go solution for particular problems.

# Structure

```
- hard                 // identified as hard problems at leetcode
    -- problem-name    // problem name
        -- s.go        // algorithm solution code
        -- s_test.go   // algorithm solution test code
        -- README.md   // optional file, explanation of this solution
- medium
    -- problem-name
        -- s.go
        -- s_test.go
        -- README.md
- easy
    -- problem-name
        -- s.go
        -- s_test.go
        -- README.md
```
