# Algorithm

This holds algorithms I practiced in programming, mainly for problems at https://leetcode.com.

Runtime for most solutions beats over 85% Go solutions at the moment submission was accepted.

# Structure

```
- hard                 // identified as hard problems at leetcode
    -- problem-name    // problem name
        -- s.go        // algorithm solution code
        -- s_test.go   // algorithm solution test code
        -- README.md   // optional file, explanation of this solution
- medium
    -- problem-name
        -- s.go
